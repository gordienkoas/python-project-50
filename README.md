# ABOUT PROJECT 

This project focuses on working with collections. Methods for constructing and traversing trees are studied. You will become familiar with different data formats (JSON, YAML), learn how to parse and form them. Start writing tests (pytest) and master development using them. Learn about continuous integration (CI) and elements of extreme programming (XP)
    

# DESCRIPTION:

****Difference Calculator****

Runs from the command line and calculates the differences between two files. Currently works with JSON and YAML.

**Start help:**

`gendiff -h`

**Running the script with default settings:**

`gendiff <file_path1> <file_path2>`

**Comparison of two-flat files: JSON.**
